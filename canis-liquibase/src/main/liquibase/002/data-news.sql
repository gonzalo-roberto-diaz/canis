Later that day, she found her beloved dog in the back of a pick-up truck, en route to a city landfill.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a painful sight that remains etched in Rubaiyaâ€™s memory: \"Kashtanka\'s body had been tossed in a pile of about 60 dead dogs\", she recalls.\nRubaiya was incensed. Her dog had been registered with city authorities, vaccinated, sterilized and collared. She was healthy and well fed. Why did they kill Kashtanka?\n<br/>\nShe soon learned that the government of Bangladesh had been killing dogs indiscriminately in an attempt to eliminate rabies - a practice that had gone on for decades. (This was the accepted, government-funded mechanism for controlling rabies across the country), notes Rubaiya.\n<br/>\nThe strategy wasnâ€™t working. Bangladesh, at the time, had one of the highest rates of rabies-related human deaths in the world.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter losing Kashtanka, Rubaiya left a comfortable job to advocate for a cause she believed in passionately: animal rights. In 2009, she founded Obhoyaronno, a non-governmental organization dedicated to saving street dogs.\n<br/>\n\"In the beginning, when we talked about animal welfare, there was little interest\", Rubaiya recalls. \"But when we talked about rabies control, people started listening. So we changed our pitch\".\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTogether with partners such as Humane Society International and the Food and Agriculture Organization, Rubaiya promoted the WHO-recommended approach of preventing rabies through dog vaccination. Speaking with Ministry of Health officials, she highlighted other countries that had successfully adopted this model, such as India and Sri Lanka.\n<br/>\nIn time, her efforts paid off. Beginning in late 2011, as part of a new national rabies elimination strategy, the government of Bangladesh began vaccinating (rather than killing) dogs on a large scale.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBangladeshâ€™s mass canine vaccination programme aims to break the cycle of transmission from dogs to humans. Evidence has shown that this can be achieved by reaching 70% of a dog population with 3 rounds of vaccinations.\n<br/>\n\"So far, itâ€™s been smooth sailing\", says Professor Be-Nazir Ahmed, Director of Disease Control in Bangladeshâ€™s Ministry of Health and Welfare. Following a successful WHO-supported pilot project in Cox\'s Bazaar, a district of Bangladesh, the government is now vaccinating dogs in nearly all 64 districts in the country.\n<br/>\nMany former dog killers have been trained by the government as friendly dog catchers. More than 1000 expert dog catchers across the country now focus on vaccinating dogs before returning them to their owners, or to the place where they were caught.\n<br/>\nDespite progress in the dog vaccination programme, financing remains a major challenge. Increased funding from both government and non-government sources will be critical to ensure its continued success, notes Be-Nazir.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder the national plan, people who have been bitten by a dog bite can access anti-rabies vaccines, free of charge, at health centres in all 64 districts of the country.\n<br/>\nBut prevention is at the heart of the national strategy, and one look at the price tag explains why. Preventing the transmission of rabies through dog vaccination costs, on average, US $3 per dog. Vaccinating the countryâ€™s 1.2 million dogs would involve a one-time cost of approximately $3.6 million.\n<br/>\nTreating rabies costs, on average, US$32 to $92 per person (a cost that would be borne over an indefinite period of time). Unless rabies is controlled at the source, treatment costs are expected to rise.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilding awareness of rabies, and the importance of prevention, is a key aim of the national plan. To that end, the government of Bangladesh and its development partners will mark this yearâ€™s World Rabies Day (September 28) with educational programmes in more than 50 000 primary schools across the country and through a series of press conferences, seminars and rallies.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe national plan identifies 2 key targets: reducing human deaths by 90% by 2015 and eliminating rabies by 2020. Results, to date, are encouraging. Before 2010, there were an estimated 2000 rabies-related human deaths reported annually in Bangladesh. According to government figures, the number of deaths fell by approximately 50% between 2010 and 2013.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThousands of people die from rabies each year, mostly in Africa and Asia. Children under age 15 are particularly vulnerable, accounting for 4 out of every 10 rabies-related deaths.\n<br/>\nIf a person is bitten by a rabid animal, WHO recommends immediate and thorough cleansing of the wound, multiple rabies vaccine injections and, in cases of severe exposure, administration of rabies immunoglobulin.\n<br/>\nSymptoms of rabies (which include fever, hyperactivity, excited behaviour, difficulty swallowing or paralysis) may appear any time between 2 to 8 weeks after the bite. Once a person develops symptoms, the outcome is nearly always fatal.','WHO','2014-09-28',338);

Remember that most owners, even if disappointed, tend to keep their pets, because of the emotional bond that is inevitably developed. These unscrupulous puppy mills count on that.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, avoid stores who sell online, to customers unseen. Advising you to avoid pet stores altogether might sound a little extreme, but you should at least definitely avoid \"impulse purchases\" at pet stores. Responsible breeders work for the betterment of the breed, and they will usually want to meet you face-to-face in order to know where the puppy is going. They will also have some sort of policy for returning the animal directly to them, if not up to standards. Mistrust providers that ship cross-country or overseas, without asking for information about you, or for an in-person pick up. Mistrust facilities that ask you to work with a specific veterinarian, offer too many different breeds, or are reluctant to inform you firsthand about their physical address.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, if you are not into serious competition, consider acquiring your pet through a shelter or a rescue organization. However, if your mind is set on a breeder, be aware that virtually every breed has one or more corresponding \"Breeder Associations\" or \"Breeder Clubs\". Consult if the breeder you have in mind is part of any of those associations.\n<br/>\nAsk yourself if there is any reason <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">not</span> to spay/neuter your prospective pet. You should expect from a good breeder to insist on that, unless you are in the show/breeding circuit yourself. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe a responsible owner.

Joanne Cox\'s family in San Diego turned to FindingRover.com, a website and app that uses technology built by university researchers, to reconnect with their dog Roxy, a Shiba inu.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe website keeps a database of photos from the three county shelters and tries to match eight distinctive facial markers on dogs with images uploaded by users searching for lost pets. Eyes and noses are important areas that differentiate pooches, including eye size and their position near the snout.\n<br>\n<br>\nFindingRover.com founder John Polimeno wants to expand the photo database to improve the odds of more happy endings, with shelters elsewhere set to sign on. He\'s also showing it to rescues, veterinarians and dog groups and is visiting other countries.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe website is unique in using facial recognition but stands among many online tools people increasingly use to find lost pets. There are alarm systems, social media alerts and apps that post rewards or call people in neighborhoods.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlus, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the largest and oldest humane society in the U.S., has its own mobile app for recovering missing pets. It offers tips on the best ways to search and allows users to create a digital flier to share on social media.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"Through research, the ASPCA has found that the best method for pet owners to find their lost pet is to get out the door, search their neighborhood, post flyers, check their local shelters and make sure that their pets have ID tags with updated information,\" said Dr. Emily Weiss, vice president of ASPCA shelter research and development.\n<br>\n<br>\nFacial recognition worked for the Cox family after Roxy bolted during a thunderstorm in late July. Five days after the dog disappeared, the family\'s 10-year-old daughter created a free Finding Rover account and the technology matched her uploaded photo to one taken at the shelter.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"Within four hours of her arrival to the shelter, we were there to pick her up,\" Joanna Cox said in an email.\n<br>\n<br>\nEvery dog entering San Diego County\'s three shelters is added to the photo database. Daniel deSousa, the system\'s deputy director, says the program can work two ways:\n<br>\n<br>\nâ€” Someone finds a dog, takes its picture and sends it to the database, where a match generates a notice to the owner. The owner then can call the good Samaritan and arrange a pickup.\n<br>\nâ€” Dogs coming in to the shelters have their photos run against the database. If there\'s a match, the owner gets a call.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe technology powering Finding Rover was built by Steven Callahan and John Schreiner of the University of Utah\'s software development center. They found the eight markers on dogs are far fewer than the 128 points on the human facial recognition program.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"People are sort of uniform, the shape of their faces, skin tones, all their eyes, noses and mouths are in the same general location,\" Callahan said. But dogs\' eyes and snouts are in different places.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt\'s difficult to measure accuracy, Callahan said, but if there are 100 dogs in a database, a top-three match would be hit 98 percent of the time.\n<br>\n<br>\n\"It worked surprisingly well, better than I thought it would.

Dog bites cause 99 percent of human rabies deaths.\n<br/>\nIndeed, tackling rabies on the subcontinent is challenging because the relationships that Indian dogs maintain with humans are ancient. Indiaâ€™s pariah dog, the dominant street breed, is probably a descendant of an early Chinese immigrant, said Peter Savolainen, a professor of evolutionary genetics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. With pointed ears, a wedge-shaped head and a tail that curls over its back, the pariah is similar in appearance to other prehistoric dogs like the Australian dingo.\n<br/>\nFor thousands of years, dogsâ€™ relationship with humans was similar to that of pilot fish with sharks, said John Bradshaw, director of the Anthrozoology Institute at the University of Bristol in Britain.\n<br/>\nâ€œDogs essentially started out as scavengers,â€ Dr. Bradshaw said. â€œThey evolved to hang around people rather than to be useful to them.â€\n<br/>\nWhile that relationship has largely disappeared in the developed world, it remains the dominant one in India, where strays survive on the ubiquitous mounds of garbage. Some are fed and collared by residents who value them as guards and as companions, albeit distant ones. Hindus oppose the killing of many kinds of animals.\n<br/>\nMalini Jadeja, who lives in Delhi part time, said she was walking her beloved dog Fudge Cake some years ago not far from Lodi Gardens when â€œtwo dogs came out of nowhere and attacked.â€ Fudge Cake was leashed, so he could not run away.\n<br/>\nâ€œI tried to grab the strays and pull them away, but just as I got one, the other would attack,â€ Ms. Jadeja said. â€œThey killed Fudge Cake right in front of my eyes.â€\n<br/>\nShe blames herself for her dogâ€™s death and remains terrified of strays. â€œItâ€™s very difficult to take a dog for a walk here because of the attacks from street dogs,â€ said Dr. Radhey S. Sharma, president of the Indian Veterinary Association.\n<br/>\nNonetheless, Indiaâ€™s burgeoning middle class has begun to adopt Western notions of pet ownership, buying pedigreed dogs and bringing animals into their homes. But many pedigreed dogs end up on the street, the castoffs of unsuccessful breeders or owners who tire of the experiment.\n<br/>\nStray dogs are dangerous not only because of their teeth but also because they help ticks and other parasites thrive. But animal welfare advocates fervently reject euthanasia, and some warn that reducing the stray population while doing nothing about the countryâ€™s vast mounds of garbage could be dangerous because rats might thrive in dogsâ€™ place.\n<br/>\nâ€œThe first thing you need to start doing to reduce the stray population is manage your garbage better,â€ said Arpan Sharma, chief executive of the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organizations. â€œAnd the second thing is very aggressive spaying, neutering and vaccinating of animals.â€\n\nJaipur has reduced its stray population, but it is a lonely exception that overcame not only enormous logistical and financial challenges but cultural ones as well.\n<br/>\nâ€œPeople really donâ€™t want us to take the street dogs away, particularly in poor areas,â€ said Dr. Jack Reece, a Jaipur veterinarian who helped lead the cityâ€™s effort. â€œIn other areas, especially Muslim ones, they wonâ€™t let us release the dogs back. I have been surrounded by large crowds, angry young men, saying you canâ€™t release the dogs here, even though they were caught from there two days before.â€\n<br/>\n<img src=\'stray-dogs-india-03.png\' class=\"newsPictureRight\">\nMore than a dozen experts interviewed said that Indiaâ€™s stray problem would only get worse until a canine contraceptive vaccine, now in the lab, became widely and inexpensively available.\n<br/>\nDr. Rosario Menezes, a pediatrician from Goa, said that India could not wait that long. Dogs must be taken off the streets even if that means euthanizing them, he said. â€œI am for the right of people to walk the streets without fear of being attacked by packs of dogs,â€ he said.\n<br/>\nArshpreet Kaur was 3 when a stray came in through her homeâ€™s open front door and bit her and her grandfather. Within a week, Arshpreet got a headache and then a fever. Her parents took her to a hospital, but she soon slipped into a coma, in which she remained for nine years before finally dying.\n<br/>\nâ€œThere are stray dogs everywhere in Delhi,â€ Arshpreetâ€™s mother, Jasmeen Kaur, said in a telephone interview. â€œWe are more scared of dog bites than anything else.â€','NEW DELHI JOURNAL','2015-01-17',300);
