Remember that most owners, even if disappointed, tend to keep their pets, because of the emotional bond that is inevitably developed. These unscrupulous puppy mills count on that.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, avoid stores who sell online, to customers unseen. Advising you to avoid pet stores altogether might sound a little extreme, but you should at least definitely avoid \"impulse purchases\" at pet stores. Responsible breeders work for the betterment of the breed, and they will usually want to meet you face-to-face in order to know where the puppy is going. They will also have some sort of policy for returning the animal directly to them, if not up to standards. Mistrust providers that ship cross-country or overseas, without asking for information about you, or for an in-person pick up. Mistrust facilities that ask you to work with a specific veterinarian, offer too many different breeds, or are reluctant to inform you firsthand about their physical address.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, if you are not into serious competition, consider acquiring your pet through a shelter or a rescue organization. However, if your mind is set on a breeder, be aware that virtually every breed has one or more corresponding \"Breeder Associations\" or \"Breeder Clubs\". Consult if the breeder you have in mind is part of any of those associations.\n<br/>\nAsk yourself if there is any reason <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">not</span> to spay/neuter your prospective pet. You should expect from a good breeder to insist on that, unless you are in the show/breeding circuit yourself. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe a responsible owner. Failing to do your homework regarding the breeder you are purchasing from, is tantamount to condoning animal cruelty.');

Remember that most owners, even if disappointed, tend to keep their pets, because of the emotional bond that is inevitably developed. These unscrupulous puppy mills count on that.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn general, avoid stores who sell online, to customers unseen. Advising you to avoid pet stores altogether might sound a little extreme, but you should at least definitely avoid \"impulse purchases\" at pet stores. Responsible breeders work for the betterment of the breed, and they will usually want to meet you face-to-face in order to know where the puppy is going. They will also have some sort of policy for returning the animal directly to them, if not up to standards. Mistrust providers that ship cross-country or overseas, without asking for information about you, or for an in-person pick up. Mistrust facilities that ask you to work with a specific veterinarian, offer too many different breeds, or are reluctant to inform you firsthand about their physical address.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nBesides, if you are not into serious competition, consider acquiring your pet through a shelter or a rescue organization. However, if your mind is set on a breeder, be aware that virtually every breed has one or more corresponding \"Breeder Associations\" or \"Breeder Clubs\". Consult if the breeder you have in mind is part of any of those associations.\n<br/>\nAsk yourself if there is any reason <span style=\"font-weight:bold\">not</span> to spay/neuter your prospective pet. You should expect from a good breeder to insist on that, unless you are in the show/breeding circuit yourself. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nBe a responsible owner. Failing to do your homework regarding the breeder you are purchasing from, is tantamount to condoning animal cruelty.');

It is most likely just a preparatory question to start extracting information abot your financial situation.');
