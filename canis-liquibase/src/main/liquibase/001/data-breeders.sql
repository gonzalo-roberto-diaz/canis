Bulldogs are a marvelous breed with their kindly disposition, resolute spirit, and the unconditional love they have for their owners. They quickly become a member of your family you couldn\'t do without.\n\n \n\nOur bulldogs are a part of our big happy family. They love to herd ducks and goats, plus they get along well with the cats. There are plenty of activities for everyone to enjoy. Being raised underfoot of such a big and loving family ensures proper socialization and training. They develop personalities just like a person would.\n\n \n\nWe are dedicated breeders of the English (style) Bulldogs. We\'re members of the Canadian Kennel Club, the Bulldog Club of Central Canada, and the Bulldog Club of America. We take so much pride in each and every one of our bulldogs. And we\'re privileged to show these dogs and we do have some of the top show bulldogs in Canada. Even though we show them, they are our pets and companions first and we enjoy seeing our dogs go to pet homes as members of the family.\n\n \n\nAs bulldog breeders we breed to the Ideal of Standard and for Health and Temperament. Our beautiful bulldogs have all features and colors, including fawn with black mask. We offer Champion Stud Service with approved mates. And with dedication we strive to strengthen the Bulldog breed\'s genetic soundness by importing Champion Bloodlines from other countries such as Europe and Belgium. Chilled and frozen Iroc Bulldog semen is available.\n\n \n\nAll Iroc Bulldog pups are placed with a written health guarantee. We\'re here to help and support anyone who wants to become part of the Bulldog family. Once a puppy is placed we\'re available for any information you may need to help you in raising your Bulldog. We want to make sure that both you and the puppy have a smooth transition.\n\n \n\n    Iroc Bulldogs are confident, happy, and healthy. This combination makes them the ideal companion for people of all ages. We hope you feel the same passion for the Bulldog breed that we do. Even though we may not always have puppies, please contact us for future availability and future breeding plans. We have so much love and pride for our bulldogs and hope that you feel the same.\n',NULL,'27','53.54410770','-113.29219070','Alberta','Division No. 11',NULL,'Sherwood Park',NULL,'Iroc Bulldogs pet breeder','pet, cat, dog, breeder, Canada');

We both grew up here and went to school here. We live about 20 minutes outside of Humboldt, Sask. where Joe farms and I raise my dogs. The dogs love it out here… where they can roam and investigate all day long!!! At night they are put in a run if they need to play outside just to avoid the prairie rodents that may wander into the yard. lol Safety is important to us. We do hope to build a kennel at some point for taking in rescues and boarding\n\nJoe and I got together later in life and decided to open Wilhardt Bulldogs. We are not a kennel, but a small hobby breeder. Our goal is to raise healthy, sound, beautiful bulldogs. All our dogs live in the house with us and are underfoot.\n\nMy love of dogs goes back to when I was a kid. I grew up with dogs and can’t imagine being without. Although we raise bulldogs, we also enjoy our boxers, Molly our brindle girl and Charlie our daughter’s fawn boy. They keep us busy and they, like our bulldogs, are quite the characters! All our dogs have enriched our lives and completed our family.\n\nI had always loved the look of the English Bulldogs and decided to start looking into the breed. About a year later, and a lot of research into the breed, I found Aldars Bulldogs in Ontario, who are now my mentors. They have been extremely patient with me as I started to raise and learn more about the breed. I give great thanks to Al and Darlene Eschelboeck for gifting me with Lizzie and Mia. They are my dream come true and the love of my life!!! Bulldogs are full of fun and a lot of laughs and I am so grateful to Aldars for giving me the chance to raise two of her beautiful puppies. I also want to give thanks to Joe, without his help, there would never have been Wilhardt Bulldogs. So, that is how it all began for us.\n\nPlease feel free to contact us if you are looking for a bully and if we don’t have any available, I will let you know of someone that does. Our dogs are CKC registered and do come with a guarantee. I breed for conformation, temperament and maintaining the breed standard. We love to take our dogs to shows and show them off!!!\n\nWelcome to our site and we hope you enjoy it!\n',NULL,'932','52.17014220','-105.11316330','Saskatchewan','Division No. 15',NULL,'Humboldt',NULL,'Wilhardt Bulldogs pet breeder','pet, cat, dog, breeder, Canada');

Only German Shepherd puppies and Dogs of sound health and stable temperament can achieve such high levels of training.

We favor mainly larger hybrids/bully dogs with good bone, impressive heads and a balanced temperament.We like dogs how they used to be when we first started\nYou will never see us breeding to flavour of the week or whatever hyped up dog\"the newbies\" think will sell..just not the way we do things here. \nWe take a lot of pride in producing our own dogs that we show and later may put in our program..anyone can buy a dog..producing one for us is where the enjoyment is, seeing the generations of your work progress and getting better. \nWe do enjoy showing our dogs and have produced many ABA Ch and ABA grand Champions,Ibc Champions and ABRA Champions, bully type, standard and some that are hybrid types..We like to stick to our own dogs rather then going out and buying what ever bulldog line maybe flavour of the week...whatever female is cheap or available.\nWe are not like most folks in that we have several different styles of American bulldogs..due to my husband and myself having different tastes in dogs... I actually don\'t think there is anyone in the world that has had a much sucess as us with both types.\nWe try and meet somewhere in the middle with our hybrid American bulldogs that we both like...but we have some large American Bulldogs and some Giant American Bulldogs that we enjoy having around.\n\nWe only produce a litter for the purpose of improving on what we have and always keep a puppy or two, we always reserve the top picks for our selves from each breeding. Some years we produce no pups and others we may have a few litters, we are not a large kennel and don\'t keep many dogs ourselves as we like them all to have plenty of time with us in and out of the house. Many of our dogs, especially our studs are raised and live with our friends and we co own or keep breeding rights on them this has proved to work out really well for both us the dog\'s and there new family.\nAll of our pups are born and raised in our home and all of our dogs are family members that will live out there lives with us,they are not retired to live with strangers or sold on to someone who wants to have a few litters out of them but remain with us for as long as they are around...this can make it hard on us as it can cause our program to not develop as fast as maybe it could as we just don\'t have the room for a lot of new dogs but that\'s fine by us.\nI can honestly say I have never sold an adult American Bulldog on to another \"breeder\" ..I really don\'t agree with passing dog\'s around especially bulldogs..\nWe have had many American Bulldogs through out the years, some that we no longer have are on our site to show you where we started and what direction we\'re heading in, you will find all our old family members on our foundation page. Special thanks to Kyle Symmes of Suregrip kennels for all his help through out the years and for all our foundation stock. \nPlease remember that although the American Bulldog is an incredible breed with a lot to offer it is often to much dog for alot of people, they are a dominant guardian breed, can be stubborn and do best with someone who has experience with such types of dogs.They also don\'t get along with dominant dog\'s of the same sex..not all of them sometimes there are exceptions but rarely.\nPlease do your research on the breed before purchasing an American Bulldog and also on the breeder you chose ...not all bulldogs are equal just the same as not all folks who are involved with bulldogs are equal!Remember your breeder should be able to answer any questions you have..that\'s what there there for ..that\'s part of what your payed for their help, guidance and knowledge though out the life of your dog...if you don\'t think they know that much why are you going to them for a puppy?\nI am honestly horrified at some of the information people are told about bulldogs..basically anything they want to hear that will help the seller sell them a pup.\nIn my opinion folks on there first litter with zero experience on bulldogs (or any breed)are not the people I would be buying a dog from..most will be gone in a year or so onto a new breed they can make a buck on and leaving the rest of us to pick up the mess.\nSadly the bulldog has got to be a popular bred and with that we get alot of folks cashing in (or trying to)..honestly I could think of a million breeds that if you were in it for the money would be far more lucrative. \nWe currently register and show our dogs ABRA...registries seem to come and go it seems one week there popular and then someone gets upset they didnt win and go to a different one, for right now we are very happy with them and there shows.. \nWe also think the best competition currently is at ABRA shows ...to be a champion with some of the other registries you need only beat \'competition \' which is one other dog! All Champion dogs are not equal... International,ARBA, UKC,ABKC, NKC shows and a few others on the East coast you can champion out on a weekend with little or no competition (here in Ca you may well be the only AB there at one of these other registry\'s shows!) ...to us that is not a Ch..yes its good practise but certainly not the same as beating competition!','11570 Park Center Dr ',NULL,'33.90123860','-117.39102470','California','Riverside County',NULL,'Riverside',NULL,'American Bulldog breeders from California','American, bulldog, breeder, California');

We eventually bred her and she became a mother of 9 bulldog puppies. From this point on I began to show and breed my bulldogs over the following 12 years. In 1979 I went to work for General Motors and with raising and putting my children through school taking most of my time, I placed all of my bulldogs into good homes. \n\nIn 1988, after all of our children finished college, I purchased several bitch puppies from excellent bloodlines and built a very nice kennel. I truly believe that the bitch is the backbone of a great breeding program. Since 1990 I have finished 10 homebred champions to become a Hall of Fame Breeder. In 1998 I received my AKC judging license to be able to judge this wonderful breed. \nI would like to recognize the time and effort that my partner Joyce Wolfe in California has put into showing and finishing several of the dogs, that we bred together. This has helped me achieve the Hall of Fame Breeder Status.

Then someone said you should show that Tri colour bitch.  This bitch was Cories Kalli.\n\nOur journey in dog showing has become a way of life .which has been very rewarding we have tried to breed a  type of border collie that we like and that judgers would also like.\n\nOver twenty five  years we have produced many litters.  Not only top winning show dogs but also a crufts winning fly ball dog who is one of the fastest dogs at fly ball in Europe.  We have also bred reliable sheep dogs, fast agility dogs, obedient dogs, field trials dogs and great couch potatoes that love the tele.\n\nWhat a time this has been, and many of our dreams have come true.  Thanks to all the judges and well wishers!  It just shows what a small kennel can achieve. \n\nAll our breeding stock is health checked and DNA clear from TNS, CL and CEA  and Unaffected from Glaucoma ,We also hip score and breed from dogs with good temperaments.
